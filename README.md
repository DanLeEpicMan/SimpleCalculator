# Introduction
Name says it all. I made this through VisualStudio while teaching myself C#. It's nothing too marvelous; more like a way to test my GUI skills (as in, designing one and adding functionality to it). 

I made this via WPF, and as such is a Windows-only GUI. [Here's a link to the Windows download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework). Running this without .NET will prompt an install.

# Explanation of Files
**Calculator** — A folder that contains an executable (exe) file of the calculator. As mentioned above, this will not work unless you have .NET installed. There's also some other files here, namely dll, runtime, and json files; I don't think they're all necessary, but I included them just in case.

**CalculatorApp.csproj** — Doesn't contain anything, will update this repo soon.

Feel free to take this and modify it however you'd like. Just don't claim it as your own unless you've added your personal flavor to it ;)
