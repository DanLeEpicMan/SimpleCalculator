# Simple Calculator
Name says it all. I made this through VisualStudio while teaching myself C#. It's nothing too marveleous; more like a way to test my GUI skills (as in, designing one and adding functionality to it). 

In order to run this, you must have the .NET Framework installed (as that's what C# is based on). [Here's a link to the Windows download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework). For those of you on non-Windows operating systems, [here's an alternative link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

Your anti-defender might flag the .exe file as a virus. I promise that this isn't a virus, but your only source of trust is a README file from the project itself, so I get it if you're hesitant. In that case, you can compile the project directly in VisualStudio.

# Explanation of Files
**Calculator** — A folder that contains an executable (exe) file of the calculator. As mentioned above, this will not work unless you have .NET installed. There's also some other files here, namely dll, runtime, and json files; I don't think they're all necessary, but I included them just in case.

**CalculatorApp.csproj** — The VisualStudio project file itself. Should contain all the code. I created this in VisualStudio 2019 and have no idea if it will work on newer or older versions (newer versions should be able to run this though).

Feel free to take this and modify it however you'd like. I do not care what you do with it.
